P26-008 Replace silent active-phase fallback (`phases[0]`) with explicit deterministic behavior (strict error or explicit warning + policy)

Implement this task in the repository. Requirements:
- Find logic that silently falls back to phases[0] when active phase cannot be determined.
- Replace this with explicit deterministic behavior: either strict error, or explicit warning combined with an explicit documented policy.
- Ensure behavior is deterministic and observable (no silent fallback).
- Update/add tests accordingly.
- Commit the changes on the current feature branch with a clear commit message referencing P26-008.
- Return a concise summary of files changed and rationale.
