Implement TASK P15-003 from TASKS.md.

Goal:
- Introduce a shared strict JSON extraction/parser utility for model outputs in src/engine/.
- Reuse it across recovery and TASKS.md import paths.
- Remove duplicated extraction logic and keep one contract-compliant parser path.

Requirements:
- Preserve existing behavior/contracts except where needed to centralize parser logic.
- Add/adjust tests to cover the shared parser utility and callsites.
- Run relevant test suite.
- Commit all changes on the current feature branch with a clear commit message mentioning P15-003.

Return a concise summary, files changed, and validation results.
